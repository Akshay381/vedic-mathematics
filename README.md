# Vedic Mathematics
The project implements Vedic mathematical algorithms in C++ and python

**add.py -**
It takes two numbers as input and returns the sum of the numbers as output.
The inputs can have any number of digits.

**multiply1.py -**
It takes two numbers as input and returns the product of the numbers as output.
The inputs can have any number of digits.

**multiply2.py -**
A slightly different implementation of multiply1.py which doesn't use a lookup table.

**remainder.cpp -**
Calculates the remainder when a number is divided by another.

**gcd1.py -**
Calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using Euclidean algorithm.

**gcd2.py -**
Calculates GCD by multiplying the common prime factors of two numbers.

**square.py -**
Calculates the square of numbers ending with 5.
